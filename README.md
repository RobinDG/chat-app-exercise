# chat-example

This is just a small exercise to discover and practice websockets using socket.io. 
It is based on [this repo](https://github.com/socketio/chat-example) which is a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.
